# QA-Portfolio
A QA portfolio documenting exploratory testing, bug reproduction and root-cause analysis. 

This repository contains examples of my QA work, including:

- Structured bug reports
- Exploratory testing notes
- Root-cause analysis and observations
- Learning exercises related to QA tools and workflows

The purpose of this portfolio is to demonstrate how I think about systems, identify issues, and communicate findings clearly.
