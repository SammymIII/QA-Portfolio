# Bug Report: Gnome Physics Exploit

## Summary
Certain gnome props can be launched or clipped through geometry due to inconsistent physics behaviour, allowing unintended traversal or sequence breaks.

## Environment
- Game: PowerWash Simulator 2
- Platform: [PC / Console]
- Build: [if known]
- Input: [Controller / Mouse & Keyboard]

## Preconditions
- Player has access to gnome props
- Physics interactions enabled
- Relevant level loaded

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Locate a movable gnome prop.
2. Apply repeated force using [tool / movement].
3. Observe the gnome interacting with nearby geometry.
4. Repeat interaction near edges or vertical surfaces.

## Expected Result
Gnome props should behave consistently with physics constraints and not allow excessive force transfer or clipping.

## Actual Result
Gnome props can be launched or clip through geometry, enabling unintended movement or traversal.

## Reproducibility
Intermittent but frequent with repeated attempts.

## Severity / Impact
- Severity: Medium
- Impact: Allows unintended traversal and breaks level boundaries.

## Notes
Issue appears related to force accumulation and collision handling on smaller physics objects.
